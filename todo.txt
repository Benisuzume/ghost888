random fix:
	closing 1/300 mysql threads at shutdown??
	the threads never get recovered? what happens when a thread gets stuck?


wishlist:
	print join/leave statistics.
		"10 individual players has joined this game the last 10 mins"
	
    autosave at drops

	possible to load saved games
		
	fromall that doesn't lag. (prioritice threads?)
