random fix:
	closing 1/300 mysql threads at shutdown??
	the threads never get recovered? what happens when a thread gets stuck?


rnd_findings:
    wc3 ver 1.28+ started using absolute path for the map in savedgames. I prevented the savegame mappath vs cfg file mappath check, and it works fine. perhaps check if the relative path is appended on the absolute path is sufficient.
    
    there are no replays from games that gets loaded from savefiles. Not even on the wc3 clients. This would pose an issue for important matches.
        Alt 1:  unpack the replay, append the played actions, repack at end. Could take time to implement.
        Alt 2:  possibility to reconnect & speed up via lan, like in the waaagh tv replays. this would create 2 separate games that cooperate. Would take longer to implement. Both would complement eachother well.


wishlist:
	print join/leave statistics.
		"10 individual players has joined this game the last 10 mins"
	
		"game probability?" (requires more than 0 games played lol).

	autosave at drops (only if inhouse? or m_Tournament/m_League) not autohosted pubs xD

	fromall that doesn't lag. (prioritize threads?)
