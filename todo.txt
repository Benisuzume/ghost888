random fix:
	closing 1/300 mysql threads at shutdown??
	the threads never get recovered? what happens when a thread gets stuck?


What do the other bots got that this one doesn't?
	possible to add features to the btanks.net website (show bt1 games)

	stats (creeps, kd)

old qualify and league options:
	really what did they got that's applicable now
		not league filtering lol.


wishlist:
	print join/leave statistics.
		"10 individual players has joined this game the last 10 mins"
	
		"game probability?" (requires more than 0 games played lol).

	autosave at drops

	possible to load saved games
		
	fromall that doesn't lag. (prioritice threads?)
