To be added to the readme.md

bncsutil specific:
sudo apt-get install libgmp3-dev
bncsutil/src/bncsutil/
make
make install
Lots of warnings, but works.

stormlib specific:
Changed wave.cpp's 0xFFFFFFFF to -1, since it caused new convention errors.
sudo apt-get install libbz2-dev
Stormlib/stormlib/
make
make install

ent-ghost:
apt-get install libboost-all-dev
apt-get install libgeoip-dev
sudo apt-get install default-libmysqlclient-dev
make


fix mysql/mariadb to have:
	a database
	a user, with grant all privileges on the database
	get the portnumber by: show variables like "%port%";

configure ghost.cfg and default.cfg
ghost.cfg has higher priority, and therefore settings made in ghost.cfg doesn't need to be set in default.cfg.

Works on raspberry pi 3 B+

create a folder, ex 
~/ghost++/
	maps/
		echoisles.w3x
	mapcfgs/
		blizzard.j (Can both be extracted from war3x.mpq)
		common.j
		echoisles.cfg
	replays/
	savedgames/
	war3.exe (rename the Warcraft III.exe to war3.exe)
	Storm.dll
	game.dll
	ghost++ executable that was compiled in ent-ghost folder.
	some more things..

I will create a cp command.

You can test if the bot can login to battle.net. For others to join the game port forwarding needs to be configured.
