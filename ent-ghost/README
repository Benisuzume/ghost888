This was my terminal history regarding ent-ghost. I will try and reproduce the installation to acertain what was necessary and what was superfluous.

1. Download the latest official GHost++ files at https://code.google.com/archive/p/ghostplusplus/downloads.
2. Replace the ghost/ source directory in GHost++ with this (ent-ghost) repository, or just move ent-ghost there. No need for replace.
3. Compile bncsutil/src/bncsutil/ and Stormlib/stormlib/ by running make and then make install.

If you encounter "make" issues, make an issue on the repo. Perhaphs it may get solved.

4. Copy the "ghost++" executable to the base of the GHost++ download

5. Follow the GHost++ installation instructions to configure in default.cfg and ghost.cfg.
"""
provide examples

show how to extract the wc3 .j files, or try fixing their code to use the new container. Atm their exctraction tries to extract from an old file.
I extracted them on my windows machine, with some hiveworkshop tool.
Think their correct mpq file was war3x.mpq, and inside scripts.
"""

6. Setup your database using the included install.sql from this repository (do not use GHost++ database schema files).
"""
Ent-ghost doesn't start if it cannot establish a connection to the mysql server, what I remember.
Do something with my.cnf
sudo vi my.cnf

mysql -u root -p ghostdb < install.sql 

one table in install.sql had no default value on "warn".

use ghostdb;
alter table bans alter warn set default 0;
describe bans;

Create a user named ghost, and grant all privileges on ghostdb to it.
"""

7. It is highly recommended to additionally setup a cron script based around the included cron_functions.php. This will ensure update of the bans and gametrack tables.

"""
crontab -e

Add the following to the end, to run the script every 10 minutes. testcron.php is included in the repo.
example:
*/10 * * * * php /usr/src/ghost/ent-ghost/testcron.php
